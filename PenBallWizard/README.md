PenBall Wizard
================

This extension is a helper for the wielding of robofab pens and functions that transform a glyphs outline. The interface is thought to manage ‘filters’, and see previews of their effects. A filter is added either by indicating a module importation string that links to existing & installed pens or functions, or by pointing to a file that will be copied and referred to as an internal module. For each new filter, you also indicate the name of the pen or function the filter exploits as well as possible arguments, which will result in UI controls for each argument.
