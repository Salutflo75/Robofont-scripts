## ScaleFast
================

This is script’s mission is simple: keep stem widths consistent while you fiddle with proportions of a glyph. It manages that by trying to compensate for scale deformations through interpolation. To do that, it requires at least two masters (a regular and bold for instance). This way, you can easily produce scaled versions of existing glyph for any purpose you see fit, small capitals, superiors, condensed versions, scaled up, down, etc. The tool’s flexibility comes a great deal from its relying on MutatorMath, written by Erik van Blokland.
