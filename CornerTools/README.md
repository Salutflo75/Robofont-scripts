## Corner Tools
================

This extension is a set of tools to work on corners of an outline. It comprises a tool available in the glyph editing view that allows you to round/cut corners by dragging to define the radius. And thereâ€™s a additional pop up window (accessible via the Extensions menu, under Corner Tools) which provides a more global set of controls.
