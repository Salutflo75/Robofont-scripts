## Interpolation preview matrix
================

Script requiring at least two master fonts open in Robofont and interpolable glyphs which allows you to preview interpolation and extrapolation based on master position in a 3x3 matrix.

The glyphs are updated at draw time, so you can modify glyphs and see changes happen live in the matrix (blue pill!).
