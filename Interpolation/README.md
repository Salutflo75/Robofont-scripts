## Interpolation preview matrix
================

Script requiring at least two open master fonts open in Robofont and interpolable glyphs which allows you to preview interpolation and extrapolation based on master position in the 3x3 matrix.

The glyphs are updated at draw time, so you can modify glyphs and see changes happen live in the matrix (blue pill!).
