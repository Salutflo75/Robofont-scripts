Glyph scripts
================

## transfer-glyphs.py

Utility to transfer glyphs from a font to another, or several others. Not all data has to come along. 

At some point, you might wonder why the script isnâ€™t doing anything, if so, double-check that:
+ 1. you do have glyphs selected 
+ 2. you do have (a) font(s)  selected.
